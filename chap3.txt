Prologue


Something flashed as it moved - aye, there! Brann stepped up to the grassy crest of the hill where his 
flock was pastured and looked east, shading his eyes against the bright forenoon sun. Whatever was 
moving caught the light again, flashing against the dark, tree clad lower slopes of the mountains 
opposite him. Out of habit, Brann looked quickly around at his flock, counting without thought. He 
found nothing amiss and peered back to the east again, looking for that moving glint to show itself 
again.
